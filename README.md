# cosmos_prototype

This is the code to reproduce the results of the chapter 3 of Aurelien Dugourd's PhD Thesis, e.i. the early prototype of the cosmosR package.

Simply clone the repository on your local machine, open the Rproject file with Rstudio and run the different scripts in the scripts folder to reproduce results.

The required packages for each scirpt must be installed.
